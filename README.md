# timetable-generation

#### This code generates a timetable according to the given constraints, using Genetic Algorithm

This code was written as part of a course assignment for Artifcial Intelligence during my Bachelor's degree in Computer Science. It is in the form of a python notebook on Google Collaboratory, and can simply be executed on Google collab.

Disclaimer: This is definitely not the best way to implement genetic algorithm for timetable generation and I am aware that there is always room for improvement. This was coded by me when I was still only halfway through my Bachelor's degree, and was still learning about Genetic Algorithm. I have only recently decided to start contributing to the open source community and start making an online portfolio so I thought a good way to start would be by publishing my older solutions.
